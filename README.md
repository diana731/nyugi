The goal of nyugi is to …

## Installation

You can install the development version of nyugi from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("diana731/nyugi")
#> Skipping install of 'nyugi' from a github remote, the SHA1 (0978a32b) has not changed since last install.
#>   Use `force = TRUE` to force installation
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to reassure someone:

``` r
library(nyugi)
# example of use: 
nyugi("Dia")
#> Nyugi, Dia, minden rendben lesz :-)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
